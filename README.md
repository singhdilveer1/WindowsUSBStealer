# WindowsUSBStealer
This is a demonstration script to showcase how batch and visual basic scripts can be used to steal a Windows user's data.

NOTICE : I do not condone any illegal usage of these scripts or any of their derivatives.
This script is a product of my past explorations. I'm sharing it in its current state, without any guarantees of future support. However, I'm happy to answer any initial questions you may have.

## This script tries to steal the following data -
- Chrome and Firefox user data.
- Logged in user's Downloads, Videos, Pictures, Documents, and their Desktop.

### The data is copied into separate subdirectories in the script's directory.
> Start the script through "start.vbs". It'll start "helper.bat" (stealer) in the background. All while avoiding any AV detections.
